# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for AI agents working in this repo. See `README.md` for the full
overview; this file captures the non-obvious conventions.

## What this is

A POC: generative RAG search over ADGM content. Next.js 15 app + Supabase
pgvector + local embeddings + Claude. The crawled dataset is already ingested;
most work is on the **search experience**, not the crawler.

## Routes

- `/` — exact mirror of adgm.com (static snapshot in `public/adgm-clone/`, served
  via a `next.config.mjs` rewrite). Refresh with `npm run mirror`.
- `/demo` — the **same** snapshot via a second rewrite; the injected demo-cards
  block is path-gated and renders only here (or with `?demo`), so `/` stays clean.
- `/v1` — the working POC homepage (`app/v1/page.tsx`) + search overlay.
- `/public-registers/fsra` (+ `/firms`, `/individuals`, `/funds`) — cloned FSRA
  Public Register; one snapshot (`public/adgm-clone/public-registers/fsra.html`)
  serves all four tab URLs via `next.config.mjs` rewrites. The dead live widget is
  hidden and replaced (injected iframe) by the **register explorer** at
  `/embed/register`. Refresh with `npm run mirror:fsra`.
- `/embed/register`, `/api/register` — chromeless register explorer + its data
  endpoint (`lib/register.ts`: classic substring filter over the normalized JSON,
  AI semantic via embeddings + `match_documents`). Tab clicks postMessage the host
  to update its URL; the host passes `?tab=` into the iframe so deep links open the
  right tab. Result cards use `target="_top"` so they escape the iframe to `/search`.
- `/search`, `/api/search` — search page and streaming endpoint.
- `/embed/search` — chromeless POC search; the `/` clone embeds it in an iframe.
  The clone's `search-button`/⌘K open it (overlay injected by
  `scripts/inject-search.mjs`, run automatically by the mirror).

`scripts/inject-search.mjs` injects three marker-bounded blocks into the clone's
`index.html` (idempotent, in order): the **hero slider** (`clone-hero-fix.html`,
hides the slow-hydrating `<adgm-hero>` and renders a self-contained crossfade
slider from the same slide data), the **demo cards** (`clone-demo-cards.html`,
an interactive showcase strip beneath the hero whose cards link to `/search?q=…`;
path-gated to render only on `/demo` or with `?demo`),
and the **search overlay** (`clone-search-inject.html`). Order matters: the demo
script inserts itself after `.poc-hero`, which the hero block builds first. If you
re-mirror, all three are re-applied automatically. Don't hand-edit the injected
blocks in `index.html` — edit the snippet files and re-run the injector.

Don't put an `app/page.tsx` back at the root — it would shadow the clone rewrite.
If `next build` errors with `PageNotFoundError` for a page that clearly exists,
`rm -rf .next` and rebuild — a dev server sharing `.next` can leave stale traces.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — run the app (port 3000)
- `npm run typecheck` — **run this after any TS change** (`tsc --noEmit`)
- `npm run build` — production build
- Re-ingest is rarely needed: `npm run ingest`, then `npx tsx src/ingestion/embed-upload.ts`

## Architecture (where things live)

- **Retrieval** — `lib/search.ts`. `retrieve()` does hybrid match → recency/listing
  override → one-hop relationship expansion. `toContext()` shrinks records for the prompt.
- **Generation** — `lib/llm.ts`. `generateSearch()` returns a structured
  `SearchResponse` via a **forced tool call** (`present_results`).
  `generateThinkingSteps()` uses a fast model for the status-line labels.
- **API** — `app/api/search/route.ts`. Streams NDJSON: `steps` → `meta` (internal) →
  `result`. Node runtime (Transformers.js needs it).
- **UI** — `components/search/`: `search-experience.tsx` (state + stream),
  `cards.tsx` (typed cards + deep links), `thinking.tsx`, `search-overlay.tsx`.

## Conventions & gotchas

- **Court subtypes**: cases, hearings, and judgments all have
  `content_type: "court"`. Distinguish them by `source_id`
  (`cases` / `hearings` / `judgments`) or `fields.courtType`. Hearings have **no
  `date` column** — their date is in `fields.when`.
- **Card deep links** (`cards.tsx` → `deepLink()`): link to the live ADGM page with
  the site's `?q=` param. Hearings need the **full** param set
  (`categoryfilter=Upcoming+hearings&psize=10&q=…&sortby=date%23asc`) or the page
  won't filter. Notice `?q=` values contain `/` → must be URL-encoded (`%2F`).
- **Recency**: generic "latest/upcoming \<type\>" queries must order by **date**, not
  similarity (vector top-K can't surface the newest). See `detectType()` /
  `recentByDate()` in `lib/search.ts`.
- **Guided flow**: broad opening query → one `clarify` question; otherwise always
  `answer` + post-answer follow-ups. Hard cap at 3 refinements. Do **not** show
  internal step counts or "step N of 3" to users.
- **Thinking labels**: short, clean, query-specific status phrases (like Claude/
  ChatGPT) — never raw chain-of-thought, never end-truncated.
- **Embeddings are 384-dim** (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`). The Supabase `vector(384)` column
  must match — don't swap the model without updating the schema.
- **Animations** must be transform-only (never animate opacity to 0 on content),
  so nothing is invisible if an animation pauses in a background tab.
- **Grounding**: every card uid must come from retrieved records; never invent facts.

## Don't

- Don't commit `.env` or anything under `data/raw`, `data/pdfs`, or `data/*.log`.
- Don't add new crawler/CLI tooling — the existing ingestion is "good enough".
